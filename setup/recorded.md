## Top Tips for Shooting Video/Live Streaming

When shooting a video for an event or live streaming, things can seem very confusing and you may not know precisely what you need to provide to us to make everything succeed. Do not fear! This document is here to provide all the information you will need to make some amazing content to show the world!

### Please make sure that your recording resolution is at least 720p (1280x720)

This is the minimum quality needed to ensure you don’t look like a block of pixels! Larger resolutions such as 1080p, 1440p and 2k are fine too - although we’d suggest if you’re shooting in 2k or above that you downsample to 1080p for transfer reasons!

### Always shoot in Landscape

As much as we all love portraits for Instagram or Snapchat, it doesn’t look as good on a big screen or in a landscape video player. Please make sure that you’re filming yourself in landscape (that’s with your phone sideways for most people).

### When filming yourself with an iPhone, use the back camera

The back camera on your phone is a much higher quality camera than the selfie camera. Try and balance your phone against something or get a small phone holder to help you position it. You can use a mirror to help you see yourself.

### In terms of formats, we prefer .mp4, but don’t worry if not!

If you know how to set your recording device up to record to .mp4, please do so - it will make the process of handling your footage much easier for us! If not - don’t worry, we’ll convert it for you!

__In the highly unlikely event that your footage is in a format we cannot convert, we will get in contact with you to help you configure your setup and make it work!__
